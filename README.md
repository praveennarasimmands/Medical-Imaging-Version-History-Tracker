# **Medical Imaging Version History Tracker**

## **Domain**: Healthcare

### **Problem Statement**
Medical imaging, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, often requires frequent revisions and updates. Clinicians may need to compare historical images to track the progression of a condition or ensure accurate diagnosis. Without version control, there's a risk of losing or overwriting critical image data. This can lead to misdiagnosis or incorrect treatment plans, impacting patient care.

### **Challenges**
- **Multiple Versions of Medical Images**: Multiple revisions and updates to medical images can cause confusion if previous versions are not properly tracked.
- **Inability to Track Changes**: Clinicians may struggle to track changes made to medical images, such as annotations or adjustments, over time.
- **Risk of Data Loss or Overwriting**: Without proper version control, there is a risk that important image data could be accidentally overwritten or lost.

### **Solution Overview**
The **Medical Imaging Version History Tracker** leverages **S3 Versioning** to securely store and manage medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. This system allows clinicians to track, compare, and retrieve previous versions of medical images, ensuring that no critical data is lost or overwritten.

### **How It Solves the Problem**
By enabling versioning on the S3 bucket where medical images are stored, this system ensures that every revision of an image (whether it's a quality adjustment, annotation, or follow-up scan) is preserved. Clinicians can easily retrieve and compare previous versions of medical images to track the progression of a condition, ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions.

## **How We Will Solve the Problems**

1. **Store Medical Imaging Files**: We will store all medical imaging files (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
2. **Track Changes and Annotations**: Every time an image is updated (whether by adding annotations or making quality adjustments), a new version will be created, ensuring all changes are recorded.
3. **Comparison Tool**: A tool will be provided for clinicians to easily compare different versions of medical images side by side, helping them analyze changes and track disease progression.

---

## **Features**
- **Version Control for Medical Imaging Files**: Every update to an image is stored as a separate version, ensuring no critical data is overwritten.
- **Image Version Comparison**: Clinicians can compare different versions of medical images side by side.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Metadata such as scan date, patient ID, and doctor's notes are tracked for each image version, ensuring easy reference.
- **Secure Data Management**: Images are securely stored and versioned in Amazon S3, reducing the risk of data loss or corruption.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Store Medical Images in S3**: Medical images (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) are uploaded to a versioned S3 bucket.
2. **Track Changes and Updates**: Any changes made to the image (like quality adjustments or annotations) create a new version in the S3 bucket.
3. **Image Comparison**: Clinicians use a user-friendly tool to compare different versions of an image to track the progression of a condition.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-imaging-version-history-tracker.git
cd medical-imaging-version-history-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: Enable S3 Versioning**

Run the `enable_versioning.py` script to enable versioning for your S3 bucket.

```bash
python enable_versioning.py
```

### **Step 3: Upload Medical Image**

To upload a new medical image, run the `upload_image.py` script. This will upload the image and store metadata such as patient ID and scan date.

```bash
python upload_image.py
```

### **Step 4: List and Compare Versions**

To list and compare different versions of a medical image, use the `list_versions.py` script.

```bash
python list_versions.py
```

### **Step 5: Retrieve a Specific Version**

If you need to retrieve a specific version of an image, run the `get_specific_version.py` script.

```bash
python get_specific_version.py
```

## **Code Explanation**

### **1. `enable_versioning.py`**: Enable Versioning for the S3 Bucket

This script enables versioning on an S3 bucket, ensuring that every new upload creates a new version.


### **2. `upload_image.py`**: Upload a New Medical Image

This script uploads medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to the S3 bucket with versioning enabled.


### **3. `get_specific_version.py`**: Retrieve a Specific Version of an Image

This script retrieves a specific version of a medical image using the VersionId.


### **4. `list_versions.py`**: List All Versions of an Image

This script lists all versions of a specific medical image in the S3 bucket.

## **Further Improvements**
- **PACS Integration**: Integrate with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) for seamless medical imaging workflows.
- **AI Integration**: Utilize AI tools to analyze and track changes in images, such as detecting tumor growth or disease progression.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **Medical Imaging Version History Tracker** provides an efficient way to manage and track medical images over time. By leveraging S3 versioning, this solution ensures that all revisions of medical images are stored securely and can be easily retrieved for review, comparison, and analysis. It improves the quality of patient care by giving clinicians access to complete and accurate historical imaging data.
